## The MeganServer workflow

<div align="justify">we present <i>megan-server</i>, a program that can serve files that are hosted on a server to instances of MEGAN running on personal computers, over the web. This uses a lightweight Representational State Transfer-Application Programming Interface (<i>REST-API</i>)-based framework 
written in Java.
This allows researchers to analyze files produced by the DIAMOND+MEGAN pipeline on their local computer, without any need to download data from a server directory.

Data is sent and received via REST which makes reuse of HTTP technology. While users can access the files using a web
browser, they will usually access the files via the MEGAN, which acts as a client and communicates with instances of
MeganServer. More details can be found in Publication</div> <br>
